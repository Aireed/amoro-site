      <description>Quickstart This guide outlines the basic process of using Amoro, allowing you to quickly experience its core features. You can choose to use either the Iceberg Format or the Mixed-Iceberg Format to complete the entire process.&#xA;If you are more interested in the Mixed-Hive Format or the Paimon Format, you can refer to: Mixed-Hive Format and Paimon Format. For specific information on the different formats supported by Amoro, please refer to: Table Format.</description>
